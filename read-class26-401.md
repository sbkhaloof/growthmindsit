2. Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?
### A Library is a set of code that was previously written by a developer that you can call when you are building your project.In Library, you import or call specific methods that you need for your project.Reusability is one of the main reasons to use libraries.
But framework is a supporting structure that gives shape to your code.In the Framework, you have to fill the structure accordingly with your code.There is a specific structure for a particular framework that you have to follow, and it's generally more restrictive than Library.
Some common examples of Framework are:
+ Angular :Angular is a JavaScript framework for web and mobile development.
+ Express : Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
