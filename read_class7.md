# REST
## How I explained REST to my brother
1- Who is Roy Fielding?
##### He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.
2- Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
##### 
3- What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
##### is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.
4- What does a GET do?
##### Each of the systems would retrieve information from each other using a simple HTTP GET.
5- What does a POST do?
##### ne system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST. 
6- What does PUT do?
##### if a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT, or, to do a partial update, it'll hopefully use PATCH
