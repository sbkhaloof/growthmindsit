# Event Driven Applications
## Review, Research, and Discussion
- Why is access control important?
#### Access controls limit access to information and information processing systems. When implemented effectively, they mitigate the risk of information being accessed without the appropriate authorisation, unlawfully and the risk of a data breach. 
- Describe an application that would need access control.
#### when you want to give access to some of the users not all and when you need to distinguish between the rights of users
- Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
#### For most business applications, RBAC is superior to ACL in terms of security and administrative overhead, better serves a company-wide security system with an overseeing administrator.it can determine how a user might change the file. 
## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
- Authorization: Authorization is a security mechanism to determine access levels or user/client privileges related to system resources including files, services, computer programs, data and application features.
- Role Based Access Control: restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.
- Capabilities: A business capability is the set of tasks or activities that a business function of an organization is potentially able to perform (acquired skills) at a certain level of performance (available capacity), but only when it is needed. 
###
**To put it in a formula: business capability = skills + capacity of a business function**

### Event-Driven Programming is a logical pattern that we can choose to confine our programming within to avoid issues of complexity and collision.
 
 #### Event-Driven Programming makes use of the following concepts:
 - An Event Handler is a callback function that will be called when an event is triggered.
 - A Main Loop listens for event triggers and calls the associated event handler for that event.
#### EventEmitter : Node.js natively provides us with a useful module called EventEmitter that allows us to get started incorporating Event-Driven Programming in our project right away.
