* is not equal to !=
* strict equal to ===
* strict not equal !===
* greater than > and greater than or equal >=
* less than < and less than or equal <=
## structuring comparision operators
###### in condition statment you must find one operator and two operands , the operands must place at each side and the operator will be between it . the operands may be variables or values , and often you can see the expresion inside brackets
###### also you can use expression with comparision operator 
## logical operators 
* and operator &&
* or  || 
* not !
## loops 
###### loops used to check a condition .if it return true a code block will run . and the condition will be check again if it return true it will run again . and it will repeats it until the condition return false
###### there are three types of loop :
* for 
* while
* Do while .
###### loop statment will be run a spiecified number of times .
###### example for for loop statment : for(var i=0;i<10 ;i++)  
###### for while loop you can write : while(i<10){ any statment you need to do ; i++;}
