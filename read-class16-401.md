# AWS: Cloud Servers
## Review, Research, and Discussion
1. Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle
### it is  way information flows through the system ; First a user gives a client a URL, the client builds a request for information (or resources) to be generated by a server. When the server receives that request, it uses the information included in the request to build a response that contains the requested information. Once built, that response is sent back to the client in the requested format, to be rendered to the user.

2. Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC
### Once the client’s request has reached the server, the server will search for and return the information the client is requesting. Often times, this means querying a database, loading the information into an html page, and returning the HTML text to the user in the body of the HTTP response.
3. What does it mean to “deploy” an application?
### It is: “Making an application available to end users”. This means that the end user has opened his/her browser, types “www.app.com” and sees the application in production, hence the www.app.com URL, fully functional!

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
+ Server: which responds (or serves) to the requests of the user-agent with information.
+ Pub/Sub:Publish–subscribe pattern is a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication used in serverless and microservices architectures. In a pub/sub model, any message published to a topic is immediately received by all of the subscribers to the topic. Pub/sub messaging can be used to enable event-driven architectures, or to decouple applications in order to increase performance, reliability and scalability.
+ WRRC: The process used by the Internet Transaction Server (ITS) to drive applications is similar in all Structure linkimplementation models.


## Preparation Materials

### What is a Virtual Machine (VM)? A virtual machine (VM) is a virtual environment that functions as a virtual computer system with its own CPU, memory, network interface, and storage, created on a physical hardware system (located off- or on-premises). Software called a hypervisor separates the machine’s resources from the hardware and provisions them appropriately so they can be used by the VM.
