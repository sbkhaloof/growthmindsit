-------------------------------------------------- 
## creating a basic javascript
###### JavaSc ript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS , so you do not need any new tools to write a script.so  you just need to Create JavaScript file with .js extention .

## LINKING TO A JAVASCRIPT FILE FROM AN HTML PAGE
###### here we will use Html <script> element and src attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored.and i want to tell you a better place to put your scripts is just before the closing </body> tag
## Data type 
| primitive data type|non primitive data type |

|       boolean      |        function        |
|       undefined    |                        |
|       null         |                        |
