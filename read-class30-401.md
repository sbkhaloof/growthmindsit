## What is a Hashtable?

Hash table is one of the most important data structures in computing. A hash table (hash map) is a data structure used to implement an associative array, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. In JavaScript we donâ€™t have any built-in hash table

Terminology :
####
1. Hash - A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. In the case of a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array.

2. Buckets - A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.

3. Collisions - A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.

Why do we use them?
