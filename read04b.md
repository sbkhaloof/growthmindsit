## as start point we will learn how to build a thinking machine as a computer had to do four different tasks. It would need to:
* take input .
 ###### there are different source for the input data as show in the fegure :

* store data .
* process information .
###### all data which are give by the input will be storge in the memory and it will be processing until it ready to be output .

###### you know the decimal number system which have ten number from zero to nine but using binary system there are just zero and one and with this system you can represented any number you need .
###### so if you use eight wire you can stor numbers between 0 and 255 but if use 32 wires then you store from zero to over 4 billion .
###### finally i want to tell you you can represent any type of data (number ,text,sound ,and videoes) with binary system
