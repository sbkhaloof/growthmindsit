# Data Modeling
## Review, Research, and Discussion
1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
+  Better program design and higher code quality
+  Detailed project documentation
+ DD reduces the time required for project development
2. In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
#### beforeEach and afterEach are running in nested suites/contexts
3. What is one downside of Test Driven Development
#### Tests got to be maintained when requirements change
4. Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
#### The class contains the Constructors and Functions. The Constructors take responsibility for allocating memory for the objects of the class. The function takes the responsibility of the action of the objects. Combing these two Constructor and Function to make the Class. In the ES6 to create any class, you need to use the class keyword.
5. Why REST?
#### Easy to Learn and Implement ,Faster Data Interchange Format,flexable .
## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

* functional programming: (also called FP) is a way of thinking about software construction by creating pure functions. 
* object-oriented programming (OOP):a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.
* class: Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes 
* super: The super keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's parent
* this: the value of this is determined by how a function is called (runtime binding). 
* Continuous Integration (CI):a fundamental DevOps best practice where developers frequently merge code changes into a central repository where automated builds and tests run. 
* REST: REpresentational State Transfer, is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other.
* Data Model :is the modeling of the data description, data semantics, and consistency constraints of the data. It provides the conceptual tools for describing the design of a database at each level of data abstraction. there are four data models used for understanding the structure of the database.
